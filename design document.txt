Feature Outline:

	Utility:
		- sends new members of the server a direct message welcoming them and explaining the server
		- greeting message
		- farewell messages as well
		- reaction roles (react to this message to gain a role, have option to make the role sticky)
		- raffle system (randomly selects user of a role, or from a list of users)
		- role guard the bot commands (only certain roles can use certain commands)

	Music:

	Games/Fun:

		- blackjack
		- russian roulette
		- translation (input language & message)
		- random bible verse, random quran verse, random bhagavad gita verse


	Longshots (unfeasable/difficult things, but could be cool down the line):
		- a music bot, but for streaming videos (movie files, youtube, etc.)
		- integrations with other bots (like wise old man, etc.)
		- look at pancake bot for inspiration (https://pancake.gg/)
		- currency system? idk if people would use that (might be fun with blackjack, robbing, etc.)
		- Ai interactions (like chatgpt, dalle, etc.)
		- calculator?

    stupid/funny/junk ideas
        - job listings in area of your zipcode (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#jobs)
        - tarot readings
        - random roasts at targeted user
        - image recognition (send an image, bot tells you what it is)
        - image manipulation (deepfry, memeify, etc.)
