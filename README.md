# VideoJoker
VideoJoker is a Discord bot, inspired by and stylized after the Video Joker character from the Wakaliwood film *"Who Killed Captain Alex?"*. 
This is for my own personal use, but feel free to fork and modify it for your own needs.

**What is a Video Joker?**

A Video Joker (VJ) is essentially a commentator who narrates and dubs over movies — originally foreign ones — in Uganda. 
This tradition began in the 1980s and 1990s when access to foreign films was mostly through bootleg VHS tapes. 
Most of these films were in English, Hindi, or Chinese, languages not understood by the majority of Ugandans. 
So the Video Joker would:

- Translate dialogue (not always literally, often adding their own flair).

- Offer context, jokes, and reactions to on-screen events.

- Often inject themselves as part of the film experience with catchphrases and recurring gags.

Even to this day, Video Jokers remain popular in Uganda, especially for action and martial arts films. 
We also see similar practices in other countries. I've always found this to be one of my favorite parts of films that have them.

**So then, what is this?**

Mostly a fun side project to learn more about Discord bots and to pay homage to the VJ tradition. 
Maybe one day this will be available to the public rather than just open source, but for now it's just for me to mess around with.
I don't even know why I spent so long on this README lol
